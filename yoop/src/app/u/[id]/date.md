is Date class and if it is then why we are not using new for const startTime??
ChatGPT said:

Excellent question — and you're right to think about whether Date is a class and how it's being used.
✅ Is Date a class in JavaScript?

    Yes!
    Date is a built-in JavaScript class that allows you to work with dates and times.

🧠 So why do we sometimes use Date.now() and not new Date()?
✅ Let's break it down:
Syntax	Returns	What it is
new Date()	A full Date object	✅ Class instance
Date.now()	A timestamp (in milliseconds)	✅ Static method
📌 Date.now() → number (timestamp)

const startTime = Date.now();
console.log(startTime); // e.g., 1720421302503

This is a number: milliseconds since Jan 1, 1970 (Unix epoch).
It's great for timing and performance comparisons.
📌 new Date() → Date object

const now = new Date();
console.log(now); // e.g., Wed Jul 03 2025 04:38:35 GMT+0530 (India Standard Time)

This gives you a Date object — better for formatting and displaying time.
✅ When to use which?
Use case	Use this
Measuring duration	Date.now()
Formatting/printing date	new Date()
Getting current time object	new Date()
Sorting numeric timestamps	Date.now()
✅ Example combo

const start = Date.now();
// ...some request
const end = Date.now();
console.log("Duration:", end - start, "ms");

console.log("Time of response:", new Date(end).toLocaleString());

🔁 TL;DR

    ✅ Date is a class

    ✅ new Date() creates a date object

    ✅ Date.now() is a static method that gives you a timestamp (number)

    🚫 You don’t need new for Date.now() — because it's not creating an object, just returning a number.

Let me know if you want to dive into formatting, time zones, or working with libraries like date-fns or luxon.

what are static methods
ChatGPT said:

Great question! Understanding static methods helps you understand JavaScript classes better — especially why we call some methods like Date.now() without new or an instance.
🧠 What are static methods?

    Static methods are methods that belong to a class itself, not to instances of that class.

✅ You call them on the class directly — not on an object created with new.
✅ Simple Example:

class MathUtils {
  static square(x) {
    return x * x;
  }

  regularMethod() {
    return "I'm an instance method!";
  }
}

MathUtils.square(5);         // ✅ Works → 25
const utils = new MathUtils();
utils.regularMethod();       // ✅ Works → "I'm an instance method"
utils.square(5);             // ❌ Error! Static method is not on the instance

📌 Real-world example: Date.now()

Date.now();      // ✅ Static method — returns timestamp (number)
new Date();      // ✅ Instance of Date class — full date object

So:

    Date.now() → static method on the Date class

    new Date() → creates an object instance of the Date class

✅ When to use static methods?

Use them when:

    The method does not depend on instance properties

    You just need utility behavior (like Math.random(), Array.isArray(), etc.)

✅ Examples from JavaScript
Static Method	What It Does
Date.now()	Returns current timestamp (ms)
Math.max(1, 5, 2)	Returns largest number
Array.isArray(value)	Checks if a value is an array
Object.keys(obj)	Returns keys of an object
✅ Summary
Feature	Static Method	Instance Method
Called on class?	✅ Yes (Class.method)	❌ No
Called on object instance?	❌ No	✅ Yes (obj.method())
Uses this from instance?	❌ No	✅ Yes
