as you told that we can't send json object but script so does axios converts object of axios.post('/api/send-message', {message:data.message}) into string under the hood
ChatGPT said:

Yes — you're absolutely right to dig into this.

Let’s answer this clearly:
✅ Does axios.post('/api/send-message', { message: data.message }) send a JSON string?

    Yes, Axios automatically converts the JavaScript object into a JSON string under the hood and sets the correct headers.

🔍 What happens under the hood

When you write:

axios.post("/api/send-message", { message: data.message });

Axios does this under the hood:

fetch("/api/send-message", {
  method: "POST",
  body: JSON.stringify({ message: data.message }),
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
});

So you don’t need to manually stringify the data or set headers in most cases — Axios does that for you automatically.
✅ Axios sets:

    Content-Type: application/json

    Accept: application/json

    Converts your JS object to JSON using JSON.stringify(...)

🧠 Summary
Feature	Axios does it?	Notes
JSON.stringify body	✅ Yes	Automatically
Set Content-Type	✅ Yes	application/json
Set Accept header	✅ Yes	Also JSON by default
Use of script tag?	❌ No	Axios uses fetch or XHR, not <script>

    💡 You only need to use <script> tags for JSONP (rare) or if you’re embedding scripts in HTML. Not for API requests like this.

Let me know if you want a comparison between fetch and axios or want to see how to handle FormData or file uploads too.
