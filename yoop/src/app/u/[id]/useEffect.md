 useEffect(() => {

    const fetchUser = async () => {
      const response = await axios.get(/api/user/${id})
      // You can set state here if needed, e.g. setname(response.data.name)
      setname(response.data.user)
    };
    fetchUser();
  }, [id]);, why can't we put async in main functionn

Great question!

You're asking:

    ❓ Why can't we make the main useEffect function async in React?

❌ Why this doesn’t work:

useEffect(async () => {
  // ❌ React doesn't allow this
}, []);

This throws a warning/error like:

    "Effect callbacks are synchronous to prevent race conditions."

✅ Why React disallows async in useEffect

    useEffect() expects the callback to:

        Return nothing (undefined) or

        Return a cleanup function

    But when you mark a function async, it always returns a Promise — not what React expects.

useEffect(async () => {
  // This returns a Promise 👇 which React can't handle correctly
  await doSomething();
}, []);

✅ Correct Pattern: Use an inner async function

React's solution is to define an inner async function inside the effect and call it immediately:

useEffect(() => {
  const fetchUser = async () => {
    const response = await axios.get(`/api/user/${id}`);
    setname(response.data.user);
  };

  if (id) {
    fetchUser();
  }
}, [id]);

This way:

    The useEffect callback is still synchronous

    The async logic runs inside the closure

    React doesn’t get confused

🧠 Summary
Do	Don't
useEffect(() => { asyncFn(); }, [])	❌ useEffect(async () => { ... }, [])
Keep useEffect synchronous	Don't return a Promise
Use an inner async function	Avoid top-level await or async inside effect

Let me know if you want a version with error handling (try/catch) or loading state too!
