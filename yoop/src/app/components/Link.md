Great question! Let me explain the difference between Next.js Link and React Link components.

## React itself does NOT have a Link component

**Plain React** doesn't include routing or navigation - it's just for building UI. For navigation in plain React, you'd use regular HTML:

```jsx
// Plain React - just HTML anchor tag
<a href="/sign-in">Login</a>
```

## Different Link Components

### 1. **Next.js Link** (What you're using)
```jsx
import Link from 'next/link'

<Link href="/sign-in">
  <Button>Login</Button>
</Link>
```

**What it does:**
- **Client-side navigation** - Changes page without full page reload
- **Prefetching** - Loads the next page in background for faster navigation
- **Built for Next.js apps** - Works with Next.js routing system
- **Better performance** - Much faster than regular links

### 2. **React Router Link** (Different library)
```jsx
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom'

<Link to="/sign-in">
  <Button>Login</Button>
</Link>
```

**What it does:**
- **Client-side navigation** - Same concept as Next.js Link
- **For React Router apps** - Works with React Router routing system
- **Different API** - Uses `to` instead of `href`

### 3. **Regular HTML Link**
```jsx
// No import needed - it's just HTML
<a href="/sign-in">
  <Button>Login</Button>
</a>
```

**What it does:**
- **Full page reload** - Browser loads entire new page
- **Slower** - Has to download HTML, CSS, JS again
- **Loses app state** - Any React state gets reset

## Key Differences

| Feature | Next.js Link | React Router Link | HTML `<a>` |
|---------|-------------|------------------|------------|
| **Page reload** | No | No | Yes |
| **Speed** | Fast | Fast | Slow |
| **Keeps React state** | Yes | Yes | No |
| **Works with** | Next.js | React Router | Any website |
| **Prop name** | `href` | `to` | `href` |

## Are they UI components?

**Yes and No:**

- **They render HTML** - Both Link components eventually render `<a>` tags
- **They add behavior** - They intercept clicks and do client-side navigation
- **They don't have styling** - They look like regular links unless you style them

## Why client-side navigation matters

**With Next.js Link:**
```jsx
<Link href="/dashboard">Dashboard</Link>
// Click → Page changes instantly, no loading screen
```

**With regular HTML:**
```jsx
<a href="/dashboard">Dashboard</a>
// Click → White screen, loading spinner, then new page
```

## Summary

- **React itself** = No Link component
- **Next.js Link** = Fast navigation for Next.js apps
- **React Router Link** = Fast navigation for React Router apps
- **HTML `<a>`** = Slow navigation, full page reload

Since you're using Next.js, stick with `import Link from 'next/link'` - it's the right choice for your app!
