Great observation — the reason you're not seeing:

console.log("✅ Response from server:", response);
console.log("📦 Response message:", response.data.message);

in the terminal is because they are inside your React component, not your backend.
🔍 Let's clarify:
🔧 There are two separate environments:

    Backend Terminal Logs

        console.log(...) inside your app/api/.../route.ts or server code

        Show up in the terminal (e.g., where you're running next dev)

        Example:

    console.log("database connected"); // ✅ This shows in terminal

Frontend Browser Logs

    console.log(...) inside your React component (like Page.tsx)

    Show up in the browser console (press F12 → Console tab)

    Example:

        console.log("✅ Response from server:", response); // ✅ Only visible in browser

✅ Solution:

To see those lines:

console.log("✅ Response from server:", response);
console.log("📦 Response message:", response.data.message);

You must open your browser's developer console:

    Chrome: Ctrl + Shift + J (or F12 → Console tab)

    Firefox: Ctrl + Shift + K

    Edge: F12

    Safari: Enable Developer Tools in Preferences first, then Cmd + Option + C

🧠 Summary:
Log Statement Location	Appears In
API route (e.g. route.ts)	Terminal
React component (useEffect, onSubmit)	Browser Console

If you want to see everything (including React logs) in the terminal, you'd have to log them on the server — but that would defeat the client/server separation of concerns.

Let me know if you'd like to log this response back to the server for any reason (e.g., for analytics, debugging, etc.).
