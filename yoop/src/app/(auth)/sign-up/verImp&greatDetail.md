okay so what i understand is that when we goes to app/sign-in/ page.tsx is shwon by browser but that is generally for get request, what fot post request and who devides that this page.tsx should be send to brower for get method

Great question!

In Next.js App Router, here‚Äôs how it works:
‚úÖ app/sign-in/page.tsx is a React component, not an API route.

So when you go to:

http://localhost:3000/sign-in

That‚Äôs a GET request in the browser, and Next.js knows:

    ‚ÄúOh, I have a page.tsx file for the /sign-in route.‚Äù

    So it renders and serves that React page to the browser.

üß† But what if it‚Äôs a POST request to /sign-in?

If your frontend (or a form) does this:

<form method="POST" action="/sign-in">...</form>

Next.js will look for:

app/sign-in/route.ts ‚Üí export function POST(req: Request)

That‚Äôs where you handle POST requests manually.
‚úÖ So who decides what gets called?
Request Type	What Next.js Looks For	Purpose
GET /sign-in	app/sign-in/page.tsx	Show UI page (React component)
POST /sign-in	app/sign-in/route.ts with export function POST()	Handle data, like form submissions
‚ú® Summary

    page.tsx is shown for browser navigations (GET requests).

    route.ts handles backend logic for requests like POST, PUT, etc.

    The browser automatically sends a GET when navigating via <Link> or URL.

    You define what to do for POST manually inside route.ts.

Let me know if you want a concrete example with form submission logic!
You said:
Next.js will look for:

app/sign-in/route.ts ‚Üí export function POST(req: Request), why next,js will look for it and not for page.tsx

That's a great question ‚Äî let's break it down carefully:
üí° Why Next.js chooses route.ts over page.tsx for POST requests:

When a user sends a POST request to a URL like /sign-in, the request is not asking for a page to be shown. It's sending data (like a login form submission) to the server.

So Next.js behaves like this:
Situation	What Next.js uses	Why?
GET /sign-in from browser visit	‚úÖ page.tsx	It‚Äôs a page component meant for UI rendering
POST /sign-in from form submit	‚úÖ route.ts with export POST	It‚Äôs an API handler meant for server logic
‚öôÔ∏è How Next.js decides

    If it's a GET request, Next.js shows the React UI (page.tsx).

    If it's a POST request, Next.js looks for the route.ts file and runs the POST() function inside it.

So:

<form method="POST" action="/sign-in">

‚¨áÔ∏è will trigger app/sign-in/route.ts ‚Üí export function POST(req: Request)
NOT page.tsx, because a page is meant to render HTML, not handle data.
üìå Summary

    page.tsx = UI shown when visiting the route (GET)

    route.ts = Backend logic executed on submitting data (POST)

    Next.js is smart ‚Äî it routes based on HTTP method

Would you like a mini example of a working form using both page.tsx and route.ts?
You said:
why doies it matter after all it is just a name and we can also show a web oage for post method
ChatGPT said:

Excellent! You're thinking deeply ‚Äî that's exactly what leads to mastery.

Let‚Äôs unpack why it does matter in Next.js (and the web in general):
üß† 1. Web Protocols Distinguish GET vs POST

The web is based on HTTP, and it defines what each method means:

    GET: Fetch a resource (like a web page)

    POST: Send data to be processed (like login info)

Browsers and servers treat these differently.
That‚Äôs why when you open a URL in the browser, it does a GET, not a POST.
‚öôÔ∏è 2. Next.js Uses File Naming Convention for Separation of Concerns
File	Purpose	Method
page.tsx	UI shown to the user	GET
route.ts	API logic (login, register, etc.)	POST, GET, etc. (as needed)

‚û°Ô∏è So even if you named both files anything you want, Next.js expects a certain structure to know what code runs for what kind of request.
üì¶ 3. Why Not Just Show UI in POST?

Technically, you can return HTML in a POST. But:

    Browsers won‚Äôt trigger POST just by typing a URL.

    You can't "visit" a POST route directly.

    It's bad UX and breaks SPA behavior.

    React and Next.js separate rendering (page.tsx) from handling data (route.ts) ‚Äî it‚Äôs cleaner and more scalable.

‚úÖ Summary

    It's not just "a name" ‚Äî it's a convention that aligns with web standards and framework architecture.

    page.tsx ‚Üí Used for UI (GET requests).

    route.ts ‚Üí Used for API logic (POST, GET, etc.).

    Next.js organizes your code based on what type of request it's responding to.

Would you like an example where the same route (/sign-in) has both a page and backend logic?
