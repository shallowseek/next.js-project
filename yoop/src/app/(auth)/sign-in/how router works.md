So signIn() **redirects to your page**, it doesn't call the API directly unless you provide credentials!,here when we go to app/sign-in, will it get loaded for get and post method

Great question!

In Next.js App Router, when you visit /sign-in (assuming you’ve created a page like app/sign-in/page.tsx), it behaves like a standard route.
✅ Behavior of /sign-in route:
1. GET Request (normal page load):

    ✅ Yes, /sign-in handles GET requests by default.

    The file app/sign-in/page.tsx is rendered.

    This is your custom sign-in form UI.

// app/sign-in/page.tsx
export default function SignInPage() {
  return <div>Custom sign-in form</div>
}

2. POST Request (form submission):

    ❌ No, app/sign-in/page.tsx does NOT automatically handle POST requests.

    If you want to process form submissions, you should send the POST to an API route like:

await signIn('credentials', {
  email: "user@example.com",
  password: "password123"
})

This sends a POST request to /api/auth/signin/credentials, not /sign-in.
✅ How Sign-In Works Step-by-Step

    User visits /sign-in
    → GET request
    → Renders your custom sign-in page (form UI)

    User submits form (calls signIn('credentials', {...}))
    → Sends a POST to /api/auth/signin/credentials
    → This is handled by NextAuth/Auth.js backend
    → If login is successful, it sets the session

❓ So when would you need to handle POST on /sign-in?

You don’t need to, unless:

    You manually handle form submission and want to POST to /sign-in directly (uncommon)

    You're not using signIn() and instead using fetch("/sign-in", { method: "POST" })

In most NextAuth setups, Auth.js handles POST internally via its /api/auth/signin/* routes, not via your /sign-in page.
✅ Conclusion:
Route	Method	Purpose
/sign-in	GET	Renders custom sign-in page (UI)
/sign-in	POST	Not handled by default (not needed)
/api/auth/signin or /api/auth/signin/credentials	POST	Used internally by signIn() to authenticate

Let me know if you want a full working example with credentials provider and a custom sign-in page.
