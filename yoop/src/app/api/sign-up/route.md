Great question! Yes, in Next.js App Router, when you define an API route using a file like:

/app/api/your-route/route.ts

the exported function must be named based on the HTTP method ‚Äî like this:
HTTP Method	Function Name
GET	export async function GET()
POST	export async function POST()
PUT	export async function PUT()
DELETE	export async function DELETE()

So, in your code:

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  // your logic
}

The name POST is not optional ‚Äî it tells Next.js which method this function handles. If you rename it (e.g., registerUser()), it won‚Äôt work ‚Äî the route will not respond to POST requests.
‚úÖ Summary:

    ‚úÖ POST is required (not just a convention) in App Router API routes.

    üö´ You cannot rename it to something else like handlePost or registerUser.

    üß† It's how Next.js maps HTTP verbs to their handlers in route.ts.

Let me know if you want to support multiple methods like GET and POST in the same route file ‚Äî that‚Äôs possible too!
You said:
why are we exporting it ??
ChatGPT said:

Excellent question ‚Äî and very important for understanding how Next.js App Router works behind the scenes.
‚úÖ Why do we use export in export async function POST()?

Because Next.js needs to access that function when it builds the API route.
üîç What's really happening:

In App Router, any file named route.ts inside /app/api/** is treated as an API handler module.

Next.js looks inside that file and looks for exported HTTP method functions (GET, POST, etc.) to match incoming requests.

So when you write:

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  // your logic here
}

You're telling Next.js:

    ‚ÄúThis file can handle POST requests. Here‚Äôs the function to run when someone sends a POST request to this API route.‚Äù

‚ùå What happens if you don't export?

If you wrote:

async function POST(request: Request) {
  // logic
}

Then Next.js won't see it ‚Äî it's just a private function. Your API route will return an error like Method Not Allowed (405) or No handler found.
üß† In short:
Why export is needed	Because Next.js dynamically loads route handlers by their exported method names.
What it allows	It allows your route file to respond to HTTP methods like GET, POST, etc.
Bonus: You can export multiple handlers in the same file

export async function GET() {
  return Response.json({ method: "GET" });
}

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  return Response.json({ method: "POST" });
}

Let me know if you want a quick diagram or visual explanation of the whole routing system in App Router!
