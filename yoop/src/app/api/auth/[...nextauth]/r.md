NextAuth provides the logic, but you provide the door that connects it to the world.

You write:

// src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts
import NextAuth from "next-auth";
import { authOptions } from "@/auth";

const handler = NextAuth(authOptions);

// ✅ This is you telling Next.js:
// "If a GET or POST request comes to /api/auth/*, use this handler"
export { handler as GET, handler as POST };

This doesn't mean you're defining the behavior — you're just plugging in NextAuth’s handlers into your route endpoints.
