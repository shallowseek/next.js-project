does setting value in form state for any field aslo sets its value in that field in ui
ChatGPT said:

Yes — setting a field’s value in the form state using react-hook-form also updates the field in the UI automatically.

That’s because the input field is bound to the form state via the register() function, so any change in the form state will reflect in the UI, and vice versa.
✅ For example:

const form = useForm();

<form>
  <input {...form.register("message")} />
</form>

If you do:

form.setValue("message", "Hello there");

→ The text input will immediately update to show “Hello there” in the UI.
✅ Similarly:

form.reset({ message: "" });

→ The input is cleared in both the form state and the UI.
💡 Notes:

    This works because react-hook-form uses uncontrolled components under the hood, but provides a controlled-like API through register.

    You don’t need to manage state manually (with useState) if you use react-hook-form properly.
