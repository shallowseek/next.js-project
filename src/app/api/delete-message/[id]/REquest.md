then there must be Request and what it does
ChatGPT said:

Yes, absolutely â€” just like you create Response objects to send data back, you also get a Request object to receive data from the client (usually the browser).
ðŸ§± What is Request?

Request is a native Fetch API class, used both on the client and in server environments like Next.js.

In Next.js App Router API routes (e.g., inside app/api/route.ts), Next.js automatically gives you a Request object as the first argument:

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const body = await request.json(); // read the body sent from the client
  console.log("Got data:", body);

  return new Response("Thanks", { status: 200 });
}

ðŸ“¦ What can you do with Request?

Here's what a Request object gives you:
Property / Method	What it does
request.method	"GET", "POST", etc.
request.url	Full request URL
request.headers	Request headers
request.json()	Parses body as JSON (for POST/PUT)
request.text()	Reads raw body as plain text
request.formData()	Parses form submission (e.g. <form>)
request.body	Raw body stream (rarely needed)
ðŸ§  Example:

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const data = await request.json();
  console.log(data); // e.g., { email: "abc@example.com" }

  return Response.json({ message: "Data received" }, { status: 200 });
}

When the browser sends:

await fetch("/api/route", {
  method: "POST",
  body: JSON.stringify({ email: "abc@example.com" }),
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
});

You can read it on the server using await request.json()!
âœ… Summary:

    Request is how your API route receives data from the browser.

    It's available in any GET, POST, DELETE, etc. function in Next.js App Router.

    It's a standard web API, so it works the same way in browser, Node.js, and Edge runtimes.

Let me know if you want a side-by-side comparison with fetch() or how to use request.formData()!
