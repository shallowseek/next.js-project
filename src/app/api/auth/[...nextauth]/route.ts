//  This is the actual API route handler for the App Router. It imports the options and creates the NextAuth handler:
//  // Example route.ts
// import NextAuth from 'next-auth'
// import { authOptions } from './options'

// const handler = NextAuth(authOptions)
// export { handler as GET, handler as POST }

// app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts
// src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts
import NextAuth from "next-auth";
import { authOptions } from "./options";

const handler = NextAuth(authOptions);
// You're exporting the handlers because Next.js App Router requires it.

export { handler as GET, handler as POST };
// ✅ This is you telling Next.js:
// "If a GET or POST request comes to /api/auth/*, use this handler"
// export { handler as GET, handler as POST };

// This doesn't mean you're defining the behavior — you're just plugging in NextAuth’s handlers into your route endpoints.


// You're saying:

//     “Hey NextAuth, you handle all GET and POST requests to /api/auth/*.”



































// Great question! You're exporting the handlers because **Next.js App Router requires it**.

// ## Next.js App Router Convention:

// In Next.js 13+ App Router, route handlers **must** export named functions for each HTTP method:

// ```typescript
// // Next.js expects these specific named exports:
// export async function GET(request) { /* handle GET */ }
// export async function POST(request) { /* handle POST */ }
// export async function PUT(request) { /* handle PUT */ }
// // etc.
// ```

// ## What Auth.js gives you:

// Auth.js `NextAuth()` returns **one universal handler function** that can handle all HTTP methods internally:

// ```typescript
// const handler = NextAuth(authOptions) 
// // handler is a function that can process GET, POST, PUT, etc.
// ```

// ## The Bridge:

// You need to "bridge" Auth.js's universal handler to Next.js's expected format:

// ```typescript
// // ✅ This tells Next.js:
// // "When a GET request comes to this route, use the Auth.js handler"
// // "When a POST request comes to this route, use the Auth.js handler"
// export { handler as GET, handler as POST }
// ```

// ## Without the exports:

// If you didn't export them, Next.js wouldn't know what to do:

// ```typescript
// // ❌ This won't work - Next.js doesn't know how to handle requests
// const handler = NextAuth(authOptions)
// // No exports = Next.js can't route requests to your handler
// ```

// ## It's like a translator:

// ```
// Next.js App Router: "Hey, I got a POST request to /api/auth/signin"
// Your exports: "Okay, for POST requests, use this Auth.js handler"
// Auth.js handler: "I'll figure out what to do with this POST request internally"
// ```

// So you're essentially telling Next.js: **"Use this Auth.js handler for both GET and POST methods"** - because Auth.js is smart enough to handle both internally based on the request details!














// q===>>>okay so we are exporting for next.js to call handler for route and auth.js handles request logic with itself
// ans==>>**Exactly!** You've got it perfectly:

// ## The Flow:

// 1. **Next.js receives request** → `/api/auth/signin` (POST)

// 2. **Next.js looks for handler** → "Oh, there's a POST export in `[...nextauth]/route.ts`"

// 3. **Next.js calls your exported handler** → `handler(request)`

// 4. **Auth.js takes over** → Analyzes the request internally and handles all the authentication logic

// ## Simple Analogy:

// ```
// Next.js = Receptionist at a hotel
// Your exports = "For any guest questions, call the Manager"
// Auth.js handler = Manager who knows how to handle all guest requests
// ```

// ## In Code Terms:

// ```typescript
// // You provide the "phone number" (export)
// export { handler as GET, handler as POST }

// // Next.js "dials the number" (calls handler)
// // Auth.js "answers the call" (processes the request)
// ```

// ## Division of Responsibilities:

// - **Next.js App Router**: Route matching, calling the right handler
// - **Your exports**: Connecting Next.js to Auth.js  
// - **Auth.js**: All authentication logic (login, sessions, callbacks, etc.)

// You've understood it perfectly! Next.js handles the **routing**, you provide the **connection**, and Auth.js handles the **authentication business logic**.
