what is resolver inside useform() ??
ChatGPT said:

Great question!

In react-hook-form, the resolver is an optional function you can pass to useForm() that lets you use an external validation library (like Zod, Yup, Joi, etc.) for form validation.
‚úÖ Why use resolver?

By default, react-hook-form uses uncontrolled inputs and HTML constraints for validation.
If you want schema-based validation, e.g.:

username: string (required)
email: string (must be a valid email)
password: string (min 6 chars)

You need to connect it to a library like Zod, and that‚Äôs where resolver comes in.
üß† How it works

resolver is a function that tells react-hook-form:

    ‚ÄúHey, use this schema to validate my form data.‚Äù

üîß Example using zod and @hookform/resolvers/zod
1. Install dependencies:

npm install zod @hookform/resolvers

2. Create a schema:

import { z } from 'zod';

const schema = z.object({
  email: z.string().email(),
  password: z.string().min(6),
});

3. Use useForm with the resolver:

import { useForm } from 'react-hook-form';
import { zodResolver } from '@hookform/resolvers/zod';

const {
  register,
  handleSubmit,
  formState: { errors },
} = useForm({
  resolver: zodResolver(schema),
});

4. Then in your form:

<form onSubmit={handleSubmit((data) => console.log(data))}>
  <input {...register("email")} />
  {errors.email && <p>{errors.email.message}</p>}

  <input {...register("password")} />
  {errors.password && <p>{errors.password.message}</p>}

  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>

üîÅ In summary:

    resolver lets you plug in external validation logic

    You typically use it with zod, yup, etc.

    It returns errors that react-hook-form understands and shows on your form

Let me know which library you're using (e.g., Zod or Yup) and I‚Äôll give you an exact setup!
You said:
resolver: zodResolver(schema),, what is tis zod resolver, i saw example of zod.parse(object)

Great observation! Let‚Äôs break this down clearly:
üîç You saw:

schema.parse(data)

This is how Zod works directly. It parses the data and throws an error if it‚Äôs invalid.

But in React Hook Form, we can‚Äôt just use .parse() directly because:

    parse() throws errors.

    React Hook Form expects a structured object with values and errors.

That‚Äôs why we need a bridge between Zod and React Hook Form ‚Üí and that bridge is the zodResolver.
‚úÖ What is zodResolver?

It‚Äôs a helper function from @hookform/resolvers/zod that:

    Takes your Zod schema

    Validates form data with it (like schema.parse(data))

    Returns errors in a format React Hook Form understands

üß† Under the hood:

// Simplified behavior of zodResolver:
function zodResolver(schema) {
  return async (data) => {
    try {
      const values = schema.parse(data); // validate
      return { values, errors: {} };
    } catch (err) {
      return {
        values: {},
        errors: formatZodErrorsForReactHookForm(err)
      };
    }
  };
}

üì¶ Example:

import { z } from 'zod';
import { useForm } from 'react-hook-form';
import { zodResolver } from '@hookform/resolvers/zod';

const schema = z.object({
  email: z.string().email(),
  password: z.string().min(6),
});

const { register, handleSubmit, formState: { errors } } = useForm({
  resolver: zodResolver(schema), // ‚Üê here!
});

üîÅ To summarize:
schema.parse(data)	zodResolver(schema)
Used directly with Zod	Used with React Hook Form
Throws error on invalid data	Returns values and errors safely
Can't be used directly in forms	Required when using Zod with react-hook-form

#q=>>>>>i have q question when does zod schema check value we wrote in fields of form while submitting or while writing and if while submitting, could not we have provided zod.parse in onSubmit fucntion

Great question! You're essentially asking:

    When does Zod validate form data when used with react-hook-form ‚Äî during typing or on submission? And couldn't we just call zod.parse() inside onSubmit instead?

Let‚Äôs break this down clearly üëá
‚úÖ When does zod validate in react-hook-form?

It depends on how you've configured the form.
üß† Default behavior with:

useForm({
  resolver: zodResolver(schema),
})

Validation happens:

    On submit ‚Üí ‚úÖ always validates

    On blur / on change ‚Üí ‚ùå not by default
    (but can be enabled)

You can control this with:

useForm({
  resolver: zodResolver(schema),
  mode: "onChange" | "onBlur" | "onSubmit", // default: "onSubmit"
})

üí° So yes, by default, Zod only checks on submit.

When the user submits the form, react-hook-form gathers the data, sends it to the zodResolver, which internally calls schema.parse() or schema.safeParse().
ü§î Why not just use zod.parse() inside onSubmit()?

You technically can do this:

const onSubmit = (data) => {
  const result = schema.parse(data); // Throws if invalid
}

But you'd lose the main benefits of react-hook-form, like:

    Showing field-specific error messages in real-time

    Tracking dirty/touched fields

    Managing form state (isSubmitting, errors, etc.)

    Preventing submit when invalid

Also, you'd need to manually handle try-catch for .parse(), and the validation errors wouldn't show inline in the UI unless you map them manually.
‚úÖ Why use resolver: zodResolver(schema) then?

Because it integrates:

    Zod's powerful schema validation

    With react-hook-form‚Äôs lifecycle and form state

That means:

    formState.errors gets auto-filled from Zod

    Invalid submissions are blocked automatically

    No need to write custom error handling logic

üîÅ Bonus: You can still validate manually

If needed, you can do:

const result = schema.safeParse(data);
if (!result.success) {
  // show custom error
}

But that's usually for advanced cases or custom buttons.
‚úÖ Summary
Approach	Validates When	Recommended?
resolver: zodResolver()	On submit (or on change/blur if configured)	‚úÖ Yes
schema.parse(data) inside onSubmit	Only when form is submitted	‚ùå Not ideal
Manual safeParse	For special cases or custom flows	‚ö†Ô∏è Sometimes

Let me know if you'd like a demo or code snippet of validation on change vs submit!
