What is a Debounce Hook?
A debounce hook is a custom React hook that delays the execution of a function until after a specified period of inactivity.
The Problem it Solves:
// WITHOUT debounce - BAD
const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState('');

useEffect(() => {
  // This fires on EVERY keystroke!
  // Typing "hello" = 5 API calls
  fetchSearchResults(searchTerm);
}, [searchTerm]);

With Debounce - GOOD:
// WITH debounce - GOOD
const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState('');
const debouncedSearchTerm = useDebounce(searchTerm, 500);

useEffect(() => {
  // This only fires 500ms after user stops typing
  // Typing "hello" = 1 API call
  fetchSearchResults(debouncedSearchTerm);
}, [debouncedSearchTerm]);

How Debounce Works:

User types → searchTerm updates immediately
useDebounce starts a 500ms timer
If user types again before 500ms → cancel old timer, start new one
If user stops typing for 500ms → debouncedSearchTerm finally updates
useEffect triggers → API call made

Real-world Benefits:

Performance: Reduces unnecessary API calls
User Experience: Less loading states, smoother interface
Server Load: Prevents spam requests
Rate Limiting: Avoids hitting API limits

Common Use Cases:

Search boxes (like Google's autocomplete)
Form validation (check if username is available)
Auto-save functionality
Resize event handlers
API calls triggered by user input

The debounce hook is essentially a "wait and see" mechanism - it waits to see if the user is done with their action before executing the expensive operation.
