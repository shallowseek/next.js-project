how they work witrh each other , explain with an example, user visiting app/api/sign-up/ and because if we are visiting any route, then it must be either of get or post method, so who will decide that page.tsx should show up only on get and not post
ChatGPT said:

Excellent question! You're touching on the core difference between App Router's page.tsx and route.ts in Next.js. Let's break it down clearly.
🔁 1. Big Picture: What's the difference?
Route type	File	Purpose	URL used from
UI Page	page.tsx	Frontend (React UI)	User visits /sign-up in browser
API Route	route.ts	Backend logic	App sends HTTP request to /api/sign-up
✅ 2. Example folder structure:

src/
└── app/
    ├── sign-up/
    │   └── page.tsx         ← visible form
    └── api/
        └── sign-up/
            └── route.ts     ← API logic (GET/POST)

🧠 3. Separation of concerns
🔹 When a user visits /sign-up in the browser:

    Next.js sees that /sign-up/page.tsx exists → renders the React page.

    This is a frontend GET request, not to the API.

// page.tsx
export default function SignUpPage() {
  return (
    <form action="/api/sign-up" method="POST">
      <input name="username" />
      <input name="email" />
      <button type="submit">Sign up</button>
    </form>
  );
}

Or using JavaScript:

const handleSubmit = async () => {
  await fetch('/api/sign-up', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify(formData),
  });
};

🔹 When the browser sends a POST to /api/sign-up:

    Next.js finds api/sign-up/route.ts

    It looks for export async function POST(req: Request) and runs that.

    This is not a page, it’s an API backend handler.

// route.ts
export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const data = await req.json();
  // Save user to DB, validate, etc.
  return NextResponse.json({ message: 'User created' });
}

❗ Important Point:

    Visiting /sign-up shows page.tsx only.
    You cannot "visit" /api/sign-up with a GET and expect a page — it's not a web page, it's an API.

If you try to open /api/sign-up in a browser:

    If GET is defined in route.ts, it will return raw JSON.

    If only POST exists, it may throw a "method not allowed" error.

✅ Conclusion
Action	What loads
User visits /sign-up	Next.js loads page.tsx UI page
Form sends POST to /api/sign-up	Next.js runs route.ts POST handler

If you'd like, I can write you a fully working example of both files.
