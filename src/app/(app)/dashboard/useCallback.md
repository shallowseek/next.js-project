 Does useCallback run on first render?

✅ Yes, on the first render, the function inside useCallback is created and returned.

But here’s the key:

    🧠 useCallback does NOT execute the function — it only returns (memoizes) the function definition.

🔁 What happens step-by-step:

const myFn = useCallback(() => {
  console.log("Hi");
}, []);

    🥇 On first render:

        () => { console.log("Hi") } is created.

        React stores it (memoizes it).

        myFn gets assigned this function.

    🚫 It does not run console.log("Hi") unless you call myFn() later in your code.

✅ Example:

const myFn = useCallback(() => {
  console.log("Hello!");
}, []);

useEffect(() => {
  myFn(); // now it runs here
}, []);

So:

    useCallback creates and remembers the function.

    You control when that function is called.

    It won’t recreate the function on future renders unless dependencies change.

n use effect everytime function is created and gets executed
ChatGPT said:

Yes, you're absolutely right — here's a simple breakdown:
✅ useEffect(() => {}, []) vs useCallback(() => {}, [])
Feature	useEffect	useCallback
When it runs	Right after the component renders	It doesn't run automatically — it's just a function definition.
What it does	Executes the function immediately after mount or when deps change	Returns the function so you can use it elsewhere
Function recreated?	✅ Yes, the function inside is re-created on every render	❌ No, unless the dependencies change
🔁 Example of useEffect:

useEffect(() => {
  console.log("🔥 This runs after first render");
}, []);

    ✅ Function gets created and run after the first render.

    ♻️ If dependencies change, it runs again.

💡 Example of useCallback:

const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
  console.log("👆 This runs only if called explicitly");
}, []);

    🧠 The function is just stored, not run.

    You'd have to call handleClick() to execute it.

Key takeaway:

    useEffect: Run something after render (like fetching data, DOM updates).

    useCallback: Memoize a function definition (usually for optimization, like passing to children or event handlers).
